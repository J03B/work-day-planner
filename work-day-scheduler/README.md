# Challenge 5 - Work Day Scheduler: Code Refactor

## Final Deployed Webpage

[Taking care of business. Open your work day scheduler here.](https://j03b.github.io/work-day-planner/work-day-scheduler/)

## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to make a work day planner website functional using Javascript and html, powered by Third Party APIs.

### Site Specifications

Create an application that enables employees to view their schedule for the work and and save updates to events throughout the day. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and JavaScript code that I have written, powered by TPI APIs. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to the time of day it is viewed.

### Mock Up

### Task Completed

This week's task was to modify existing code, otherwise known as refactoring. This process is to improve it without changing what it does outside of the acceptance criteria so it meets a certain set of standards or implements a new technology. In this case, a company has hired me to refactor their exisiting code to generate a viable product for daily event scheduling.

One of the most important considerations is to ensure that it meets the company criteria, documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

#### Exceeding Expectations

To impress clients, I always strive to exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, the sctructure of the codebase was optimized to ensure everything functions and everything is organized for future development. I clean up, organize, and consolidate code into properties and functions, organizing files to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, including comments for each important element or section of the page.

## Instructions

### Testing the deployed site

To test the changes made for this project, you can ensure that the deployed site shows all hours of a work day and is updated based on the time of day it is viewed. The goals for this project are listed out in the acceptance criteria below. 

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

Please note that I do not "own" the final project and its contents in this repository. Please consider the project an example of work that I have done to quickly satisfy a client's basic needs.
